### Technoligies Used 
This website was made with the MERN stack using: 
* HTML 
* CSS 
* Javascript
* Bootstrap
* MongoAtlas
* Heroku
* Mongoose
* Express
* React
* Node.js


#### Collaboration and Approach Taken
The project idea was developed as a group. Github, Heroku and Atlas were worked on as a team and linked together. Back end server was created and linked to the back end database to create an API. The app.js file was worked on by the group collaboratively, merging all conflicts and organizing the branches cohesively.
As a team we developed a cohesive workflow that allowed us to work on individual branches, merge them together, and test them for errors before deploying at checkpoints to the main application. Most of the styling was created with Bootstrap and assisted with CSS and inline styling for properties that were unable to be written in Bootstrap. The users collection took some time to connect successfully on local host. Ultimately, the login feature was successfully debugged. The middleware placed at the bottom of the app function had to be separated and moved from the object. The login was added as a proof of concept and does not inhibit the user from read and write functionality on the website. To end the project we added the tab title and navigation logo.


##### Unfinished Functionality
We ran out of time and were unable to place the content behind the login feature.  
Did not change the Date to a Date in the schema to time stamp the new article/updated article.  
Did not place different sections in components.  
Ran out of time to create a sidebar to place images in the public folder as adds.  
Ran out of time to disassociate the "Show More/ Show less" buttons from all toggling together.  
Unable to figure out how to make one index full screen and hide all other indexes.
